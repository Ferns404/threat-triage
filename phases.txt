Phase 1: 
Static Analyzer: Write a Python script to scan a file's properties (like hashes and text strings) and check its reputation with the VirusTotal API.

Phase 2: 
Sandbox Environment: Use Docker to build a safe, isolated "victim" container where we can safely run files.

Phase 3: 
Dynamic Analyzer: Upgrade our script to run the file inside the sandbox and automatically log its behavior (like any files it creates).

Phase 4: 
Final Report: Have the script combine all this information into a single, easy-to-read report.
